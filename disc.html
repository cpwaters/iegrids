            <p>This site will be updated periodically as I learn more about CSS Grids in IE.</p>
            <p>I do not profess to know or am a master of CSS Grids and/or CSS in general. I made this as a source of reference to anyone who needs it.</p>
            <p>If you would like to comment on my code or CSS Grids in general feel free to contact me at <a href="mailto:cp-waters@hotmail.co.uk">cp-waters@hotmail.co.uk</a>.<br>
            I'm all for professional positive criticism for further development and learning.</p>
            <p>I would like to thank <a href="https://rachelandrew.co.uk/">Rachel Andrew</a>, <a href="https://css-tricks.com/">Chris Coyier</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/eskins">Richard Eskins</a> &amp; <a href="http://www.derrenwilson.net/">Derren Wilson</a>
            for their help, guidance and reference.</p>
            <p>No religious beliefs were meant to be offended by the referral of IE as "the devil incarnate", nor the persecution on Internet Explorer and it's partners. 
            <br>This is called "having a laugh!, bants! etc.".</p>
            <p>The whole page is not built in Grids, that would be overkill for such a small presentation.</p>
